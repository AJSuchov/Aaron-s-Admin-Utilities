# AJ-s-Admin-Utilities
This is my first ever attempt at creating "Software". This software is a basic GUI that has multiple built in functions that allow for easy use that admin and IT personel may use. This software is being made from Python 3 with tkinter as GUI frame.


How to create executable using setup.py and Utilities.py:
1. pip install cx_freeze if you have not already or get cx_freeze 
2. Put all files into the same folder.
3. open command prompt on that location or navigate to it using command prompt.
4. Run python setup.py build and an exacutable will be built.
4.5. run python setup.py bdist_msi if you want an msi installer.
